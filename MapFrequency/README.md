# BOARDEDITOR
> Tool For Assisting The Creation of Boards for a game I am working on with a group

#
### Description

Codname Boardeditor is an application programmed in python using the pygame library that either reads/edits a map from an adjacency list that is stored from in a json file or can create a new json file to read/edit boards.

The original purpose of this application is to create board prototypes for future use in the upcoming game Project Orpheus and to display useful information of maps like most frequent spots of a map assuming a person can move an arbitrary amounts of steps each turn.

#
### How To SetUp

1. Download Boardeditor.app for mac or Boardeditor.exe for windows (*linux support will be added later*)
2. Open Application to create a blank map of size (*currently preset*) named *prototype.json* or drag a json file to the application to continue editing a previously made map.
